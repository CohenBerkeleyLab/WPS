Various versions of WPS are available as branches.
Run "git branch" to see available branches.
Then run "git checkout <branchname>" to get the desired version.

To add a new version, use "git checkout -b <name>" to create a new branch
named "<name>" then replace the WPS files with the new version.

You will probably want to checkout the .gitignore file from master
to ignore any compiled files.
